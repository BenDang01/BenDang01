## Hi there, I'm Ben 👋

I'm currently working as a consultant in data and research consulting firm. I have a strong interest in data-driven strategy, product innovation, and customer-focused technology.

🧠 I thrive at the intersection of business, data, and creativity. With experience across consulting, marketing strategy, and analytics, I love using data to solve real-world problems, build smarter solutions, and deliver meaningful customer experiences.

🚀 I am always excited to collaborate on impactful projects — especially anything involving data, design, or innovation.

🤝 I'm also happy to share what I know and learn from others.

🎧 Outside of tech and analytics, I enjoy discovering great music, hiking, and playing musical instruments 🎸. Balance keeps the creativity flowing.
